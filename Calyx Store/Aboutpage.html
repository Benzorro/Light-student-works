                    <p>Gain access to a larger, targeted audience: Affiliates or content creators have an established audience who listen to them. 
                       And their audience ideally aligns with your own.  This means whenever an affiliate recommends your business on their channels,
                       they share your brand to a larger, yet still targeted, audience you wouldn’t otherwise have the same access to.</p>

                    <p>What makes affiliate marketing especially ideal for startup businesses? It doesn’t require a huge amount of capital to start. 
                       You only pay affiliates a commission when they bring in a new sale, meaning you won’t spend money unless you see results. 
                       Plus, you also set the affiliates’ commission rates, meaning your startup can mitigate your risk by setting rates which you’re sure you can afford.</p>

                    <p>Recruiting affiliates costs less than paid ads or hiring marketing agencies. In affiliate marketing, you only pay commissions
                       for a sale that has occurred, unlike with PPC marketing campaigns. There’s no money needed upfront to sign on affiliates,
                       which creates a low-cost marketing investment perfect for startups with limited budgets. .</p>

                    <p>As a startup, hiring marketing agencies can be costly. Affiliates can bring the same knowledge and experience to your campaigns, 
                       without the need for extensive resources. Since they’re running their own business and have also promoted others, you can expect the same value from them.</p>
